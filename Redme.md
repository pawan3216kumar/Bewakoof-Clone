## Description
 Nowadays the shift in focus of sales operations for goods and services from hand-to-hand to virtual sales is driving us to put greater emphasis on electronic selling .

For years, online stores have been widely advised for businesses that rely on the selling of goods and services. These types of websites serve as a global device that connects clients to all relevant information, products, and services through a single portal.

Those online shopping sites allow customers to take advantage of the available virtual fair which is updated daily without the slightest constraint, which will allow them to never miss their favorites, without problems of geographical distance, working hours or availability of transport. On the other hand, these sites allow the company to take advantage of this space to expose its products to a wider customer base We hope you enjoy and we look forward to your contributions!
